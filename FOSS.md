# Verifpal's Free and Open Source Policy

## Purpose
This document defines Symbolic Software's policy for the use of free and open source software in externally distributed products. This document provides a common framework for FOSS compliance for Symbolic Software's team and organisation, to establish intent to respect Free and Open Source Software and to contribute purposefully to open communities.

## Policy
Procedures, work instructions, training, and tool support must be established to implement compliance processes for each of the following use cases:

### Inclusion of FOSS in Verifpal's deliverables
The compliance process shall include:

- Identification of all FOSS contained in Verifpal's deliverables;
- Review of license identification and, if applicable, compatibility analysis;
- FOSS license identification of obligations and the correspondent satisfaction of obligations.

### Third party commercial software acquired for distribution in Verifpal

A developer that delivers software to Verifpal must disclose any FOSS contained in its deliverable, including:

- A list of all FOSS components, including their version numbers;
- All applicable licenses (not only the main license but each applicable license);
- Material for product documentation (including but not limited to license texts, copyright notices, acknowledgments and attributions);
- Source code for the FOSS (when applicable), including any modifications made by the developer;
- Dependency charts illustrating the dependencies, interfaces, and interactions between the FOSS components and any other product components.

### Specific rules for server software
If server software includes FOSS licensed under the Affero General Public License (AGPL) or similar license, such use must be reviewed and approved according to the process defined for FOSS included in a Verifpal deliverable. If server software is distributed to a third party for hosting or distributed to an external party for any other purpose, use of any FOSS must be reviewed and approved.

### Contributions to FOSS projects
Symbolic Software wishes to encourage contributions and community involvement in order to advance worthy technologies and projects. For the purposes of this policy, “contribution” means making software and/or related material (descriptions, documentation) for which Symbolic Software holds the copyright available to third parties, or to the general public, under an FOSS license, granting access, modification and/or distribution rights with regard to the software in source code form.

Plans for contributions (both collective and individual) should be reviewed and approved beforehand. Approval This policy should be effective immediately upon approval.
