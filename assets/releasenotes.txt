Verifpal 0.19.0 modifies the behavior of freshness queries.
Now, freshness queries will check if a value is ever *used* while
non-fresh, and not simply contradict the query if a value can ever *be*
non-fresh. This is based on discussions with Eric Simpson.

An example model in examples/test/replay-simple.vp is provided to
illustrate how this is supposed to work.

Verifpal 0.19.0 also fixes a problem that caused VerifHub submissions not
to be possible if Verifpal was installed via Snapcraft, thanks to a patch
submitted by Eric Simpson.

Finally, Verifpal 0.19.0 binaries are built using Go 1.15 (with the exception
of Snapcraft binaries).
