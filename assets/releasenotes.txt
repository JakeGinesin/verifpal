Verifpal 0.13.5 introduces many important fixes:

- A class of missed attacks has been resolved. See the discussion here: https://lists.symbolic.software/pipermail/verifpal/2020/000250.html

- In many cases, Verifpal's analysis speed has been sped up significantly. For example, Verifpal's integration test suite now finishes in roughly half the time compared to before.

- Verifpal's analysis output is now significantly improved. For example, Verifpal now mentions which output of a primitive was recovered by the attacker.

- Some minor fixes.
