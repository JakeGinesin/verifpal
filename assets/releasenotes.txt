Verifpal 0.13.7 fixes two bugs in Verifpal's analysis, both identified and reported by Georgio Nicolas:

- Values declared using Verifpal's password qualifier may result in false positives being identified by Verifpal despite no such attack having taken place in the model.

- Partial resolutions of targeted values in confidentiality queries may have led to missed attacks in certain scenarios.

This release also improves the reproducibility of Verifpal builds and introduces code-signed releases, as discussed on this mailing list thread:
