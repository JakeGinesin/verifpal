In this release, we continue the 0.10.x trend of focusing on a more comprehensive analysis. 0.10.2 improved the scope of the analysis by allowing HKDF values to be mutated by the attacker, but this introduced an enormous state space explosion overhead. In 0.10.3, we improve the heuristics used by Verifpal in order to attempt to reduce the potential for state space explosion and keep analysis fast/actually terminating. Heuristic improvements come at the risk of reduced analysis completeness, something which we will need to continue to evaluate as Verifpal grows.
