In this release, we add the new "leaks" expression, which allows principals to leak values to the attacker without necessarily sending them to one another over the network, like this:

principal Alice[
    knows private verySecretSecret
    leaks verySecretSecret
]

The attacker now knows verySecretSecret.

Other minor improvements and optimizations are included.
